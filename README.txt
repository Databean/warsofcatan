Congratulations on your purchase of Wars of Catan!
This program recreates the popular board game, Settlers of Catan, with a few added features.

To begin, ensure you have 4 players. The player whose birthday is closes to the current day is player 1, and will command the Southern Tribes.
Players are subsequently assigned clockwise from player 1. This assignment must happen before launching! Run the enclosed executable warsofcatan.exe.

Players control the following empires:

Player 1: Southern Tribes
Player 2: Western Watch
Player 3: North Guard
Player 4: East Raiders

Each player begins the game with one road building card, to be used however the player sees fit.

For rules on playing the game, see catan.com/service/game-rules

To purchase any of the structures available in the game, click on the corresponding button at the bottom left.
To purchase a development card, click on the Development card text at the bottom right.

Note: Purchasing a wonder requires 5 of every resource, and grants an instant 10 victory points.

FAQ: 
Q:  Why can't I see how many resources I have?
A:  To discourage cheating, resource totals are obscured upon changing turns. A player can see his/her totals by clicking the "Display Totals" button.

Q:  How can I contribute to the project?
A:  The project is open source, and hosted at http:github.com/Databean/warsofcatan. Contributors should reference warsofcatan/src/BoardLayout.txt/

Q:  How did you come up with the idea for the wonder? I've literally never had so much fun with a gameplay element.
